        pre-allocation is unavailable, or Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ) is
        full. SBD-to-MITE switch true penalty cycles happen after the merge
        mux (MM) receives Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) Sync-indication until
        receiving the first MITE uop. MM is placed before Instruction Decode
        Queue (IDQ) to merge uops being fed from the MITE and Decode Stream
        Buffer (DSB) paths. Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) inserts the
        Sync-indication whenever a Decode Stream Buffer (DSB)-to-MITE switch
        occurs.Penalty: A Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) hit followed by a Decode
        Stream Buffer (DSB) miss can cost up to six cycles in which no uops
        are delivered to the IDQ. Most often, such switches from the Decode
        Stream Buffer (DSB) to the legacy pipeline cost 0–2 cycles]
